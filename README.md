# Bikepicker

Bikepicker is CRUD app design to allow the user to build bespoke bikes. It allows them to create a basic bike and add a frame, wheels, etc. 

The price, weight and various other stats for these components will be added up. Users will have to sign in to be able to create and vote on bikes.
